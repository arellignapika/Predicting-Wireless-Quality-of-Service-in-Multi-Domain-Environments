# Predicting Wireless Quality of Service in Multi-Domain Environments

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting wireless Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as latency, throughput, and reliability in multi-domain environments. Using the Berlin V2X dataset and CatBoost (CBC), the analysis explores how network parameters influence QoS and how predictive models can optimize it.

## Objectives
- To preprocess and analyze the Berlin V2X dataset.
- To implement and evaluate the CatBoost Regressor for predicting QoS.
- To derive insights into the importance of features affecting QoS.
- To visualize results for better interpretability.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing

#### Steps:
- **Loading the Dataset**: The Berlin V2X dataset was loaded and inspected for initial understanding.
- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - Missing values were imputed using the `SimpleImputer` with mean and median strategies.
  - Categorical columns were encoded using the `OrdinalEncoder`.
- **Scaling Features**: Numerical features were scaled using `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler` to normalize the data for better model performance.

#### Visualization:
- **missing values for training set**:
